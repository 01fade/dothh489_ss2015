# Motion Tracking

Video can be found here: [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0azmweey7wnxd5b/motiontracking_720p.mov?dl=0)

I manually tracked the motions from parts of the following sources:

[Orca Rescue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pRHO1psAYY
)

[Butterfly Swimming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6n_SrjLypA
)

[Paper planes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AZOcCdmEo4)

I think I can probably simulate the motion of the last two with a sine function.
